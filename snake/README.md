# Snake
Snake is one of the most common classic games you can attempt to recreate. There are a lot of variations on this game, this one features a snake that eats “food” and that only grows when it eats. This snake also crawls on a playfield that contains obstacles.

## Additional exercises
* Add scoring and a score counter.
* The function put_food() does not take into account the position of the snake, nor where obstacles are. Fix that.
* If the game is over, show a “game over” message, then allow the player to try again.
* Extra points: add a player 2 snake.
