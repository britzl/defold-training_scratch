# 15 Puzzle
This well-known puzzle became popular in America during the 1870s. The goal of the puzzle is to organize the tiles on the board by sliding them horizontally and vertically. The puzzle starts from a position where the tiles have been scrambled.

## Additional exercises
* Make a 5⨉5 puzzle, then a 6⨉5 one. Make sure the solvability checks work generally.
* Add sliding animations. Tiles cannot be moved separately from the tilemap so you will have to come up with a way of solving that. Perhaps a separate tilemap that only contains the sliding piece?
