# Sidescroller
The game is extremely simple. The player controls a space ship and is supposed to collect stars that appear on the screen. The ship is controlled with the up and down arrow keys on the keyboard.

## Additional exercises
* Award points for picking up stars. Perhaps show score using a label?
* Add special stars that award more points.
* Add enemies that need to be avoided.
